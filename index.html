<p> My name is Freedom a student of Codetrain, and a proud Ghanaian. My hobbies are playing basketball and knowing more about technology. I love and like to explore myself to discover new things and to know the "how","when","what" and the "where" about of my discovery.</p>
<p> I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. I don't talk much about what I can or cannot do, because I prefer my work to do the talking for me.</p>
<p> I also like to listen to music a lot, infact my best friend is music. I don't know how but I confined more into music than to people. Dogs and some other animals are my favourite pet. I also like to eat anything rice and likes trying out new dishes</p>
<h4 id="respect"> I respect a lot but as the saying goes "respect is reciprocal", therefore I wouldn't look your way if you don't recpect me.</h4>
<p> My dream is to become a well successful person in everything that I do. One of the most reasons why I joined Codetrian is my love for technology and transformation and I pray at the end of the one year program with them if am not the best, then be part of the best team ever to complete their program.</p>
<h2> To conclude, I love being myself. </h2>
<h2 style="color: #fff"> Thank You.</h2>
